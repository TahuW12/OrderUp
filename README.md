# OrderUp

OrderUp is a new solution to the ever growing need to inform customers of their order, while keeping costs lower
than current competitors, such as buzzer devices.

# How does it work?

OrderUp utilises the Python language together with a Twilio API to send text messages to a number entered by the staff.

# How do I use it?

OrderUp is simple to set-up, requiring an account and subscription with the Twilio service, and a file containing the access
credentials. With these steps complete, simply set the quote as desired in Quote.txt, run the program, and begin entering
phone numbers to inform customers when their food is ready.
